# opebabel-wheels
This repository contains the Python Wheels for Windows for Open Babel 3.1.1

For some reason, the OpenBabel in pypi contains wheels for Python 3.7, but not for later versions. The wheels can be found in Christoph Gohlke's Windows wheels website, but they are not downloadable by pip from there.

So we took those wheels and put them here.
